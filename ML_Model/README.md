# MedIo Machine Learning Models

The following repository contains three folders:

-2D_CNN_RGB (developped by Luka Stojanovic, Pedro Oliveira and Robert Nash for their project AI BASED IDENTIFICATION OF MEDICINES ran in 2020 and supervised by Prof. Miguel Rodrigues at UCL), modified to fit our dataset.  <br /> 
-3D_CNN <br /> 
-dual_channel <br /> 

Each folder correpond to a different method we experimented during our project. In each folder there is one main notebook and a second one which corresponds to data pre-processing. In addition, there is a notice to expalin how to set-up properly before running these algorithms.
