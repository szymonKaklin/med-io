## What is it?

Med.io is being built as part of an MEng university project. The app will allow users to identfiy pills using their smartphone camera, as well as store prescription information tied to their specific user account.

### TODO

+ ~~Prescription editing/adding~~
	+ ~~Add optional image to prescriptions~~
	+ Specific prescription updating
+ User account creation
	+ Firebase user authentication
+ Back-end
	+ Post request with image to model

### Known Issues

+ You can add multiple prescriptions at the same time by pressing the add prescription button too quickly
+ Prescription list does not automatically refresh when a prescription is removed - a manual refresh by pulling down on the list is required
+ Login Password field glitches out visually on long strings; but validates correctly
