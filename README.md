## What is it?

Med.io is a React Native, iOS/Android app being built as part of an MEng university project. The app allows users to identfiy a selection of pills using their smartphone camera, as well as store prescription information on those pills tied to their specific user account.

Note: this is a proof of concept project, pill identification results are not always accurate and should not be used to as a guide.

## Core Features

- Take a picture of a pill (or upload one from your image library) to post it to a CNN model hosted on Google Cloud for identification.
- If the pill is present in our database and has been identified you can:
  - Add it to your prescriptions OR see the prescription for this medicine if one is already present in your saved prescriptions
- Add prescriptions for a medicine and select an image to represent the prescription
- Create a user account (using Firebase) and store your prescriptions on the cloud, enabling acess across devices.
